It's been a rought last couple of weeks with many transitions that are still ongoing and/or haven't been easy. I'm still behind in my coding class, but gradually making progress, making meaningful strides in learning, and catching up. Today was difficult as I've been sick all day, but feeling better and doing some coding before starting the work week tomorrow. 
In a good note, I got some crepe cake from **Lady M**, a pop-up shop that's currently in Bellevue.
>_Pricy?_ Yes.
>_Worth it?_ I think so.
The delicate layers of thin crepes held softly together by sweet cream was a tasty delight after these last few days. 
If you get a chance to try it, I recommend at least popping by as they're not always here!
